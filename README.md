# Week-7-Assignment

This is a group assignment.

Create a menu-based program using C++ to implement the discussed sorting algorithms and compare their performance.

 

Create an integer array of size 10000. Fill in the array with random numbers. Apply each of the following sorting algorithms to sort the array in ascending order. Please use the provided algorithms and code from Blackboard, Zybook, and lecture notes.

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Bubble Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Before applying each algorithm:

Make sure to call a function that re-initializes the array to the original state where it is randomly filled.
Save a copy of the original array.
Ask the user to select a sort algorithm from a menu.
Apply each sort function.
 Print out the first 50 elements of the array to make sure that it is really sorted (your sort algorithm is working correctly).
